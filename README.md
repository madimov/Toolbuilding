Toolbuilding

A set of tools to help you organize and explore *your* system of tools.

To open the Toolbuilding System:

    1) run the create_tsb.py module
    2) follow the instructions & prompts

In your current directory you'll find a potentially useful folder system organizing the various permutations of interactions between tools, as well as a file recommending possible combinations of interest.

This is a work in progress, very much at the embryonic stage.
